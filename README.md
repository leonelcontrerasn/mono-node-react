This is a monorepo where we made a review about how to apply advanced concepts in Nodejs and React topics like:

- Caching data with redis in order to improve the time response
- Testing beyond unit testing with Jest and Puppeteer

- How to inyect new functionality to third party libraries without affect
the base functionality.

And much more.
